# NoSQL Social Network
A social network API that utilizes MongoDB as a means to build an unstructured NoSQL database, so that my social network may process a large amount of data within shorter time frame. The API itself incopereates full CRUD operations using express routes. The data modeling & manipulation is done with Mongoose. <br/>
This is a web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.
